jar	izr	Jarawa	Hill Jarawa	ph	split into Gwak [jgk] and Bankal [jjr]: jarawa1961: the dialect is that of Fobur near Jos. HH: The language called Jarawa in Lukas&Williams 1961 is neither Jarawa [jar] or its splits Gwak/Bankala. It is Hill Jarawa from Fobur, and which belongs to Izere [izr].	http://www-01.sil.org/iso639-3/documentation.asp?id=jar
gny	pue	Günün Yajich		saphon	INVALID IDENTIFIER. HH: Gununa Yajich usually means Puelche [pue]. DRM: Regarding Gününa Yajich, the SAPHON source is Adelaar 2004 _Languages of the Andes_ and (as far as I can tell from the google books preview) all the data about the language seems to be traced to Casamiquela 1983. So Puelche [pue] it is.	
adc	mcd	Arara do Acre		saphon	INVALID IDENTIFIER. DRM: The SAPHON source for Arara do Acre is: Emerson Carvalho de Souza 2012, Aspectos de uma gramática shawã (pano) [http://etnolinguistica.wdfiles.com/local--files/tese%3Asouza-2012/souza_2012_shawa.pdf]. The author acknowledges in a footnote (page 12) that it is the same language as that described in Cunha 1993, and that Shawã is the autoglossonym. HH: Looking at it again, both the Cunha 1993 and de Souza 2012 should be Sharanahua [mcd] not [knt] (I was wrong, or rather, Ethnologue is wrong in having Arara do Acre in two places, the place withing Sharanahua [mcd] is the correct one, following Fleck (attached) who knows his Pano).	
gio	gqu	GELAO		upsid	split into Qau [gqu] and Aou [aou] with some going to Green Gelao [gig]. HH: I have them filed as Wanzi Gelao = Qau [gqu], don't remember exactly why but it's probably right. Though these Chinese things sometimes have notes on lots of varieties so possibly there are data there on other Gelao varieties as well.	http://www-01.sil.org/iso639-3/documentation.asp?id=gio
